Thank you for visiting and wishing to check out my weather app code, all the info needed to understand specific sections are written as comments inside the js, html, and css files. I wanted to create a weather app in order to improve my web development skills, through this I learned how to implement css, how to use an API, and what XMLHttpRequest is used for. This was definitely a rewarding experience and a stepping stone to improve my web development skills even more.
